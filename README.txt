App Name: Recipe Resort

Decided for my React MVC Project to start creating a system that people can store and share recipes on.

Will have features including allowing a user to login, signup, search for a recipe, storing data in a recipe, changing their password, and error handling.

Looking for ways or ideas at some point on how I can share or create a way for users to share their recipes to eachother.

A user will be able to create recipes, write information about those recipes and store those into the database.

I want to make this a useful application for people who are looking to cook at home as we're all stuck in our homes at this point in time.
