# App Name: Recipe Resort

Decided to create a site that will allow a user to store recipes, and categorize them by price, food category, and taste. The goal is to allow a user to easily store recipes and write notes about these recipes. 

This app can profitable as many people now are stuck within their homes looking for recipes to try. The original goal of this application was to allow users to share their recipes, but wasn't able to do that due to time constraints. The application now can store recipes a user inputs and search them. 

Implemented/refined features for users to to login, signup, look at an about page, search for a recipe, selecting a favorite recipe, changing their password, error handling, removing recipes, editing information inside of a modal for notetaking and searching for recipes.

Structured my app in React using bundles in the hosted folder for my local side. For my Heroku side, used Client to display the same functionality. Included handlebars in views as well for html and implemented more from controllers and models.

Was able to store data of recipes including their price, taste, name, and food category.

Went above and beyond by using bootstrap, adding search implementation, a success handler for password change, and the addition of a modal for the information tab.
