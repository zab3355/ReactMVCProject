Decided for my React MVC Project to start creating a system that people can store and share recipes on.

Still implementing how a user can change their Password and updating Domo elements to be relevant for my project. Going to add more elements as well including price and tags for spicier/sweeter/sour foods.

Looking for ways or ideas at some point on how I can share or create a way for users to share their recipes to eachother.

A user will be able to select a recipe and get very specific instructions on how to make that recipe.

I want to make this a useful application for people who are looking to cook at home as we're all stuck in our homes at this point in time.
